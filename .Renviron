# .Renviron is good for setting environmental variables like a user library or
# API keys
# to check environmental variables within R, use Sys.getenv()

# where to install new packages
R_LIBS_USER=~/.R/library
# I'm not sure what R_LIBS_SITE does as it is "" by default
#R_LIBS_SITE=~/.R/library

# it seems that my new packages are now downloaded into ~/.R/library but they
# can be loaded either from there or the root directory. 

# remove package from ~/.R/library
# remove.packages("package name")
# dependencies are not automatically removed
